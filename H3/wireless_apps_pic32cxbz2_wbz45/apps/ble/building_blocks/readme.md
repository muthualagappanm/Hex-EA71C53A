# PIC32CX_BZ2/WBZ45x BLE Application Building Block Examples

Welcome! this repository covers PIC32CX_BZ2_WBZ45x Application Building Blocks
Building blocks are compact training modules revolving around implementing a particular BLE functionality/feature on PIC32CXBZ2 and WBZ45x Devices. These training modules ease users development experience by providing a step by step procedure to build a BLE Feature from Scratch.
Moving through the building block users will be able to gain familiarity
with SDK, MPLAB Harmony software development framework, MPLAB Code Configurator, API's necessary for implementing the BLE features of interest.  
Users who have working knowledge of BLE and no familiarity with
Harmony  framework, Microchip BLE SDK, Tools etc., are recommended to start their SW development process with Building Blocks.

**Tip:** New MPLAB Code Configurator Users are recommended to go through the [overview](https://onlinedocs.microchip.com/pr/GUID-1F7007B8-9A46-4D03-AEED-650357BA760D-en-US-6/index.html?GUID-B5D058F5-1D0B-4720-8649-ACE5C0EEE2C0).

Building Blocks are divided into 2 catergories based of the device roles and features users are interested to develop. This segregation is important as users interested to develop only a certain type of device would be provided only the training modules related to the device type
